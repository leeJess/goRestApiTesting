Section 2: API Test

## Installing Cypress
Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#Direct-download) to download/install cypress. This test is written with _direct installation_ in mind, but if you're more comfortable with a different method and you can make it work, you're welcome to do so.

The next step is to clone this repo. You can either use git, the 'download zip' function on GitHub. You should then be able to run cypress on this and get our basic setup. The Cypress window will ask you to open a directory - using the file browser, select the directory where you stored the code from this repository.

## How to run the test?
Go into cypress fold and you may simply input the terminal 
```
npx cypress open
```
or
```
npx cypress run
